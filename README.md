### Describe our platform <br>
This paltform had be made on AWS Cloud service(Lambda, S3, DynamoDB) with Google Cloud Platform(GCP) <br>
`self architecture` is the block what the service model introduce for your self. <br>
In this example, we have been implement to web architecture using `AWS Cognito service`.<br>
But, the platform architecture looks like accepted a variable service(Device, Smart phone, etc..).<br>
<br>
And i choose `Speech to Text api` on GCP to voice recognition. <br>
